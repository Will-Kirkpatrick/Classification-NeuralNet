This is a repository for some of the code I worked on outside of my chemistry research.
The classification neural network is trained on the FASHION MNIST database. It also contains a few examples of predicting items of clothing.
The regression neural network is trained on a sine curve, with the prediction data plotted alongside the training data.
Both neural nets were developed following the NNFS textbook. Thanks to Harrison Kinsley.
